<abstract>This feature set contains the physical locations of proposed development projects contained in residential building permits issued in the San Francisco Bay Region from 2014 through 2016. The information was gathered by surveying the regions 101 cities and 9 counties. They were asked for the Annual Housing Element Progress Report they submitted to the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) and permitting spreadsheets that contained location information. After the permit information was compiled, each jurisdiction was sent a copy of their list to verify the accuracy of the list and provide them with an opportunity to comment and make corrections.The attributes for the features in this dataset are available in a separate table (Residential Building Permits (attributes)) available for download as an Excel file. The point features from the permit location data can be joined to the attribute table using the joinid column. The attribute table was separated from the feature set so staff could maintain information for residential building permits that could not be geolocated and include information for jurisdictions that either did not respond or had no development activity for a given year.</abstract>
