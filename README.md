<img alt="Landing page large screen" src="images/titleimage.jpeg" width=600>


### Description
Application for predicting median home price for the Bay Area counties using linear regression model(s) based on the past trends (since 1990).

### Hypothesis
Some of the factors that influence Housing affordability and Median home prices include:

    1. Population Growth,
    2. New Housing Constrction(permits),
    3. Median Household income and/or the average earnings of buyers.
 
Hypothesis: The reason for the astronomical rise in the housing prices in the bay area in the past few years is the increasing gap between the demand (population and wage growth) and supply (new housing contruction). This widening gap will futher accelerate housing price increases in the future.

### Project Presentation
The interactive app will help user to predict Median Housing price at Bay Area level as well as County level for a chosen year in the future.

Possible Visulaizations:

(Median Home Price or Housing Affordability Index(HAI)) vs. Population Growth

(Median Home Price or Housing Affordability Index(HAI)) vs. No. of Housing Units

Tools used:

    Data clean up and parsing with Jupyter Notebook using Pandas, numpy & OS library.

    Flask App

    Tableau or Plotly for Visualization

    HTML, CSS, Javascript to built the webpage for the app.
